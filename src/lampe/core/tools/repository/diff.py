    """Get the diff between two commits, optionally filtering files by glob patterns.

    The filtering is done in a specific order to ensure correct pattern application:
    1. First, if include patterns are provided, only files matching those patterns are kept
    2. Then, exclude patterns are applied to filter out matching files
    3. Finally, reinclude patterns can override the exclude patterns to bring back specific files

    This order ensures that reinclude patterns only affect files that were actually excluded,
    preventing the reinclude of files that weren't matched by include patterns in the first place.

    Parameters
    ----------
    base_hash
        Base commit hash to compare from
    head_hash
        Head commit hash to compare to. If not provided, uses HEAD
    files_exclude_patterns
        List of glob patterns to exclude from the diff (relative to repo root).
        These patterns take precedence over include patterns.
    files_include_patterns
        List of glob patterns to include in the diff (relative to repo root).
        Note that exclude patterns will override these if there are conflicts.
    files_reinclude_patterns
        List of glob patterns to re-include files that were excluded by the exclude patterns.
        These patterns will only affect files that were previously excluded.
    repo_path
        Path to the git repository
    batch_size
        Number of files to process in each batch.
